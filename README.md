## Module 2: Ask Questions to make Data-Driven Decisions
As we learn the **6 Phases of Data Analysis**, this is the first step, Ask. To clearly understand and indentify the problems, data analyst need to ask the right questions to clarify the given problem. (before proceed to doing further steps) Moreover, we will get to know how to ask the **SMART questions** that will help you when asking questions.

- **6 Phases of Data Analysis** (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act)
- **6 Problem Types** (Making predictions, Categorizing things, Spotting something unusual, Identifying themes, Discovering connections, Finding patterns)
- **SMART Questions** and Questions that should be avoided asking
- Report vs. Dashboard
- **6 Stages of Data Life Cycle** (Plan, Capture, Manage, Analyze, Archive, Destroy)
- **Structured Thinking** and Scope of Work (SOW)
- Communication Skills & Types of Stakeholder

## Module 3: Prepare Data for Exploration
After you know the problem clearly, the second step is Prepare data. This step involves **"How the data will be collected fairly?"**, knowing the **Data Structures & Formats**, learn more on what is **Data Ethics**? until understand the data policy agreement, and how to secure your data.

**Week 1:**
- How to collect the data? (Interviews, Observations, Forms, Questionnaires, Surveys, Cookies)
- **Data Collection Considerations**
- **Data Formats** (Structured/Unstructured, Discrete/Continuous, Qualitative/ Quantitative, Nominal/Ordinal, Primary/Secondary, Internal/External)
- **Data Model** (on Structured data)
- **Wide & Long Data Format** (wide data format is preferred, more used)

**Week 2:**
- **4 Types of Data Bias** (Sampling, Observer/Experimenter/Research, Interpretation, Confirmation Bias)
- **"Good" Data Sources should be "ROCCC"** (Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, Cited)
- **6 Aspects of Data Ethics** (Ownership, Transaction transparency, Consent, Currency, ***Privacy***, ***Openness***)
- **Data Anonymization** (protecting people's private or **sensitive data** by eliminating that kind of information by marking/hashing)

**Week 3:**
- **Relational Database** (Primary/Foreign/Composite Key)
- **Metadata** (Descriptive/Structural/Administrative)
- **Naming Conventions**
- Workshop on BigQuery (SQL)

**Week 4:**
- Organizing Data
- Data Security (protecting data from unauthorized access by adopting safety measures)

**Week 5:** (Optional)
- Online Prescence
- Networking

## Module 4: Process Data from Dirty to Clean
After you get the data, it's time to clean your data!, there are many several that has been used to clean the data, in this module will be covered Spreadsheets and SQL
(to use which tool it depends on where data lives and size of data) Moreover, you will know what exactly "CLEAN DATA" is, what things that you might have to check? e.g., Whitespace, Length of text string, Reasonable values, No duplicated records, and so on. Then, the next step is the verficiation and reporting (documentation) about the changes involved in your data-cleaning effort. (It allows you to revert back to check/use this version, and also team to get on the same page)

**Week 1:**
- **Data Integrity** (accuracy, completeness, consistency, and trustworthiness of data)
- **Types of Data Issues that may occur** (Duplicate, Insufficient)
- **Types of Insufficient data** (from only 1 source, keeps updating, outdated, geographically-limited data)
- **How to address/deal with with Insufficient data?** (have image)
- Statistics terms (Margin error, Confidence level, Statistical significance)

**Week 2:**
- **Dirty data vs. Clean data**
- **Types of Dirty data**
- Data Merging (from two/more datasets into a single dataset)
- ***Workshop on Spreadsheet*** (Cleaning data) such as Conditional Formatting, Remove duplicates, Trim whitespace, VLOOKUP()
- Workflow automation

**Week 3:**
- Difference between cleaning data on Spreadsheet and SQL
- ***Workshop on SQL*** (Cleaning data) such as CAST(), CONCAT(), COALESCE(), SUBSTR(), TRIM(). Other functions: CASE WHEN THEN, DISTINCT, COUNT() and many more

**Week 4:**
- **Verification** (confirm that a data-cleaning effort was well-executed and the data is accurate and reliable)
- **Documentation** (tracking changes, additions, deletions, and errors involved in your data-cleaning effort e.g., doing Changelogs > concept like Version Control on Git)
- Big Picture when verifying data-cleaning (Consider the Business problem, Goal, and Data)

**Week 5:** (Optional)
- Building your resume to become more objective and professional
- **PAR technique** (Problem, Action, and Result) that should be used when explaing on experiences section
