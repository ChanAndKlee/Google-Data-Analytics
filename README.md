- **Wide & Long Data Format**

**Week 2:**
- **4 Types of Data Bias** (Sampling, Observer/Experimenter/Research, Interpretation, Confirmation Bias)
- **"Good" Data Sources should be "ROCCC"** (Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, Cited)
- **6 Aspects of Data Ethics** (Ownership, Transaction transparency, Consent, Currency, ***Privacy***, ***Openness***)
- **Data Anonymization** (protecting people's private or **sensitive data** by eliminating that kind of information by marking/hashing)

**Week 3:**
- **Relational Database** (Primary/Foreign/Composite Key)
- **Metadata** (Descriptive/Structural/Administrative)
- **Naming Conventions**
- Workshop on BigQuery (SQL)

**Week 4:**
