### Step 1: Ask
- to define a problem to be solved.
- to help focusing on the actual problem and avoid any distractions.
- to make sure yu full understand the stakeholder's expectations.
- to see the whole situation in context.

#### Questions to ask yourself in this step:
1. What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?
2. How can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?

### Step 2: Prepare
- what metrics to measure.
- locate data in your database.
- create security messures to protect that data.

#### Questions to ask yourself in this step:
1. What do I need to figure out how to solve this problem?
2. What research do I need to do?

### Step 3: Process
- to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies.
- to remove repeated entries.
- to use spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data.
- to use SQL functions to check for extra spaces.
- to check for bias in the data.

#### Questions to ask yourself in this step:
1. What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?
2. How can I clearn my data so the information that I have is more consistent?

### Step 4: Analyze
- to perform calculations.
- to combine data from multiple sources.
- to create tables with your results.

#### Questions to ask yourself in this step:
1. What story is my data telling me?
2. How will my data help me solving this problem?
3. Who needs my company's product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?

### Step 5: Share
- to make more informed decisions via graphs or dashboards.
- to share results with stakeholders.

#### Questions to ask yourself in this step:
1. How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engagine and easy to understand?
2. What would help me understand this if I were the listener?

### Step 6: Act
- to act on your data.
- to provide your stakeholders with recommendations based on your findings to make data-driven decisions.

#### Questions to ask yourself in this step:
1. How can I use the feedback I received during the share phase to actually meet the stakeholder's needs and expectations?

To summarize, these six steps help you break down the data analysis process into smaller, managable parts, which is called "Structured Thinking" that involves four basic activites:
1. Recognizing the current problem or situation.
2. Organizing available information.
3. Revealing gaps and opportunities.
4. Indentifying your options.

## Six Problem Types
Data analysts typicall work with six problem types:

**Note:** By now you might be wondering if there is a difference between categorizing things and identifying themes. The best way to think about it is: categorizing things involves assigning items to categories; identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes. (In a user study, user beliefs, practices, and needs are examples of themes.)
